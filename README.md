# üå± Soil Saint

**Soil Saint** is a full-stack web app that lets users ask plain-English farming questions and get intelligent, data-driven answers. It uses the **OpenAI API** to convert natural language into SQL queries that fetch information from a **MySQL** database.

## üß† What It Does

Users can type questions like:

> ‚ÄúWhat crops grow best in acidic soil during spring?‚Äù

The app responds with helpful insights pulled from a structured database of farming knowledge.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**  
   Provides a clean UI for users to enter their questions.

2. **Backend (Python)**  
   Receives the question and sends it to the OpenAI API for interpretation.

3. **OpenAI API Integration**  
   Converts the user‚Äôs natural language input into an appropriate **MySQL query**.

4. **MySQL Database**  
   Executes the generated query to return relevant farming data.

5. **Response to User**  
   The results are formatted and shown to the user in a helpful, human-readable way.
